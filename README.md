# wifi setup

This script installs & set ups everything needed for a headless raspberry pi
to be connected to a known wifi by a user without ssh knowledge.

It creates a QR code which can be printed and then scanned by mobile,
the user can then enter wifi credentials, and it auto-connects.

it also fixes ips and stuff.
